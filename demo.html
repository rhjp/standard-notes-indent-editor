# Nimble editor

This is a demo of the SN Nimble Editor for Standard Notes. This is just a slightly modified version of the Indent Editor that adds: enumerated lists, language names with code blocks, and colored headings.

Go ahead and type and try out the various features/behaviours.

## Indentation

Indentation is preserved on `Enter` and when wrapping lines. Hitting `Tab`  will indent the current line (or selection) by two spaces, and hitting `Shift-Tab` does the inverse.

The characters `* - > +` are counted as prefix/indentation and will also be preserved (along with spaces) on `Enter` --- this facilitates list making utilizing those characters as item markers.

  - This is an indented list item. You can hit `Tab` or `Shift-Tab`with the cursor anywhere in this line to increase or decrease the indentation. Hitting `Enter` starts a new item at the same indentation level.
  - This is the next item. You can probably see how indentation is preserved when wrapping lines just by looking at these two items.

In addition, using an integer or single letter followed by a period and a space will act like an enumerated list item. Wrapping and indentation will happen as with above list items, and hitting `Enter` will start the next item with an automatically incremented item (this only applies to integer or single letter based enumerated lists):

  1. This is item one
    a. This is item one, sub-item 'a'. Wrapping occurs as usual in lists or sub-lists, and numbers or single letters will auto-increment predictably --- however, letters will only increment up to 'z' or 'Z'.
    b. If you need more letters than that, the first step is to admit you have a problem ... ;) 
  2. This is item two
  3. This is item three

## Headings

Markdown headings (atx style) prefixed with one or more `#` characters will be styled in both size and color. This styling applies with any leading "indentation"  characters as well (so they can be in a list for example), but that, of course, won't apply to any markdown post-processing you might do to the text:

 * # The big one! A single number sign.
 * ## Headers can be indented, including after the usual *->+ characters!
 * ### This one is just bold, not bigger. Thats with 3 number signs.

## Links

Things that look like web addresses (with or without the `https://` protocol) will be highlighted and the links can be opened in a new browser tab if you `Ctrl-Click` on them. For example, hub.darcs.net/jandrew/sn-nimble-editor, or https://standardnotes.org.


## Code 

You can use `backticks` to have a piece of code in a line as shown in several places in this demo. Code blocks in triple backticks is also supported:

  ```
  #!/usr/bin/bash
  echo "hello world"
  ```

You can also add a language name (or any non-space sequence of characters) following the opening backticks:

```ruby
puts "hello world"
```

## A few keyboard shortcuts

* `Ctrl+D`: Duplicate the current selection, or the whole line if nothing is selected.
* `Ctrl+Shift+Up`: Move current line (or selected lines) up by one line
* `Ctrl+Shift+Down`: Move current line (or selected lines) down by one line
* Many others, this editor is based on CodeMirror, which has its own set of shortcuts for things.
